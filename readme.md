A Quick and Dirty Example APP
================================

Hi, this is my first time using Node.js and playing with the assignment to create a simple app which gets tweets and when selecting the text of a tweet, to show a wikipedia entry for that text as well as a few images. 

I used backbone.js for the front-end, bing (strangely) to get the images, as flickr had me in a loop of "you're signed in as username, please sign-in as username", which was not very useful. 

This is the first time I've had anybody actually do a proper review of my code, so I'm looking forward to hearing comments. 

Thanks
Pete
